# 1D-bar-element-FEM-Matlab
This is a Matlab program for solving one dimensional Bar element in Finite Element analysis. 
Q. â€“ A stepped bar is made of 2 materials joined together as shown. The bar is subjected to an axial pull of
10kN. Determine displacements. E1=200Gpa, E2=120Gpa, A1=200mm2, A2=180mm2.
